    <li>Use <a href='#library'>Libraries</a> to view the set of small
      molecule and RNAi libraries available for use at the 
      <a href="<%= app_data.facility_url %>" target="_blank"><%= app_data.facility_name %></a> 
      Screening Facility. For each library, you can view descriptive
      information on the Library Viewer page. From that page, you
      can navigate to the Wellspage, to browse the contents
      of each library well and reagent information including
      structures, SMILES strings, and links to PubChem, ChemBank,
      and GenBank.</li>
    <li>Use &quot;Search for Wells&quot; to search for information on library reagents,
      using library plate/well designations or vendor-assigned reagent identifiers.</li>
    <li>Use <a href='#my_screens'>My Screens</a> to view your own screens and result
    data, and <a href='#screen'>Screens</a> to view basic information about other screens 
    performed at ICCB-L. For your own screens, you can browse, filter, sort, 
    and export your result data, and compare it to other shared screen results 
    and studies.  You can also export the screen result data as a spreadsheet (xls, csv, or sdf).
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size: small">If your screen result data
          is not shown, please contact <a href="<%= app_data.contact_informatics_url %>">
            <%= app_data.contact_informatics_name %></a> and we will make it a priority to import your
          data.</li>
        <li style="font-size: small">The amount of screen results visible 
          from any screens other than your own is dependent upon your 
          small molecule and/or RNAi data sharing level. Please contact 
          <a href="<%= app_data.contact_facility_director_url %>">
            <%= app_data.contact_facility_director_name %></a> if you have any questions.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li>Use <a href='#study'>Studies</a> to view the studies that have been
      added to Screensaver. Studies associate annotations with library reagents.</li>
    <li>Use <a href='#activity'>Activities</a> to view the activities you
      have performed at <a href="<%= app_data.facility_url %>" target="_blank"><%= app_data.facility_name %></a>.</li>
