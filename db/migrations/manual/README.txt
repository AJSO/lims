NOTE: strategy will be to collect all of the migrations that were developed in the prototype, and 
    collect them here in the "0001_initial_conversion.py" script.
    The stock "initial" should be re-created at release time and will not need this script.
    


Other:
* These migrations must be run before the corresponding South migrations are run *
So "0003_screen_status.sql" is run before "0003_screen_status.py"
